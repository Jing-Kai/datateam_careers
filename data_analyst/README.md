## Interviews

### Assignment

We, [KKStream](https://www.kkstream.com.tw/en/), had hosted competitions on Kaggle in 2017, and made available de-identified playback data sets from [KKTV](https://www.kktv.me/). One of our Kaggle in-class competitions aimed at predicting the time when customers watched drama. Detailed description and the submission instructions are available on the competition link.

To complete the assignments, join the competition and get the preprocessed dataset. Then make submissions as many as you can within 7 days, which will be evaluated with AUC by Kaggle and revealed on leaderboard. After you are done, send back the source code (we prefer Python or R, no notebook please) and MD5 of your best submissions along with your Kaggle account for confirmation.

As our intention is to evaluate your skill, not take advantage of you, feel free to refuse providing the source code if you beat the 2nd benchmark on leaderboard.

### Presentation

We want to know you. Once you get the invitation to the interview, please make a slide to present things that you want to share with us. Topics you can include are:

* (must) self introduction
* (must) how you have done the assignment
* (optional) your pet projects
* (optional) how you participated the other competitions
* ...

### Whiteboard Coding Test

> Before you are a data scientist, you must be a programmer.

There will be a whiteboard coding test during the interview. However, we have different expectations comparing to the other teams. It is good if you can come up with a solution during the test. If you can't, we will guide you to solve the problem. The bottom line is, you are expected to complete the code after we revealing the details of the solution. Here are 2 examples.

``` python
def to_odd_even(nums):
    """
    given an integer list, rearrange it so that all odd integers are placed
    before even integers.
    """


def to_negative_zero_positive(nums):
    """
    given an integer list, rearrange it so that all negative integers are
    placed before zeros, and all zeros are placed before positive integers.
    """
```
